          <p class="description">
            Hi! I’m Sebika Khulal, a Computer Science student at Texas State
            University with a minor in Mathematics. I love building applications
            that combine clean design with practical functionality. From
            full-stack development to UI enhancement, I enjoy turning ideas into
            interactive, user-centered experiences. Recently, I’ve worked on
            projects like a travel app with real-time navigation and a coffee
            shop finder app where I handled both design and development. I’m
            passionate about continuous learning, solving problems creatively,
            and bringing a bit of aesthetic flair into everything I build.
